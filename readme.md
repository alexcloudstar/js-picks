# JavaScript Picks

## Hi there! 👋🏻

### Short introduction:

My name is Alexandru Romila as a nickname i'm using Alex Cloudstar so let's keep it that way.
I'm learning/doing programming from 2015. First 4 years until 2019 I hesitate to learn JavaScript (only God knows why).
But from 2019 until now i'm using it & learn it everyday.
This JavaScript Picks as I named this repo is nothing more than some picks which i get from different articles/tutorials etc.

> Please note, these are some really quick things about JavaScript and
> if you want to learn more about it there are plenty tutorials, books,
> articles etc.

If you have some quick tip or anything about JavaScript you are free to create a new branch from _main_ and create a PR.
I'll try to update it as much as I can.

> all have are own caveats and turn arounds situations.

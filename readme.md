# JavaScript Picks

## Hi there! 👋🏻


### A succinct introduction

Let's keep it that way. My name is Alexandru Romila, and my nickname is Alex Cloudstar. I started studying and practicing programming around 2015. I hesitate to learn JavaScript for the first four years until 2019 (only God knows why). However, I've been using it and learning it daily since 2019. This JavaScript Picks repository, as I have titled it, consists only of some picks that I have collected from various articles, tutorials, and other sources.

  

> Note that these are only a few basic facts about JavaScript; if you're
> interested in learning more, there are many tutorials, books,
> articles, etc. available.
> 
Create a new branch from main and a PR if you have any fast advice or knowledge of JavaScript.
I'll make every effort to keep it updated.

> circumstances.
